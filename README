orchastack-core

orchastack-core endeavors to make OSGI as a full featured container for distributed application, including JTA, JPA, security supports 
and MQ client for Kafka and rabbitMQ. It's build on iPOJO, which is a service framework for OSGI.

Java developers just write pojo with annotaions like:

@Component 
@Provides(specifications = { orchastack.core.itest.biz.UserJpaService.class }) 
@Instantiate public class CopyOfUserJpaServiceImpl implements UserJpaService {

@PersistenceContext(unitName = "orcha-entity")
private EntityManager persist;

@RequiresRoles(value = "admins")
@Transactional(timeout = 4000, propagation = "requires")
public CloudUser1 saveWithTx(CloudUser1 user) throws Exception {

......
}
..........
}
then orchastack help you to inject the whole dependencies.
